# Napkin

## Log

- 2026-02-09 - ahs migration - User wants data migration SQL to be generated by script, not hand-authored, so reruns are deterministic and auditable.
- 2026-02-09 - conversion UX - Reused `FloatingCartButton` dialog state for a new top-of-profile `Contact Seller` CTA while keeping the bottom-right floating button.
- 2026-02-09 - product review correction - Public listing has a bottom-right floating contact/cart action; it was easy to miss in snapshots because icon-only controls lacked clear labels in the accessibility tree.
- 2026-02-09 - product review - When asked for customer-value feedback, run Playwright on public flows (home -> catalogs -> catalog -> listing -> auth modal) and prioritize activation, conversion, and retention gaps with concrete examples.
- 2026-02-09 - e2e observability - Force `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_ENABLED=false` in Playwright local config and `webServer.env` so local E2E never initializes Sentry.
- 2026-02-07 - e2e cleanup - Full suite stabilized after removing most custom timeout/retry/poll code and validating with repeats.
- 2026-02-07 - e2e issue - Profile content sometimes disappeared after reload due autosave race; fixed by waiting for `userProfile.updateContent` response after blur.
- 2026-02-07 - e2e issue - Clerk modal has variant state: after email click `Continue`; after code entry do not submit again (auto-submit). If warning says code wasn't sent, click `Continue` once.
- 2026-02-07 - e2e issue - Select/popup items can be outside viewport; `scrollIntoViewIfNeeded()` before click fixed intermittent failures.
- 2026-02-07 - e2e issue - Listings row-action dropdown was flaky in CI/local when relying on generic role selectors or `force: true`; stable approach is explicit row-action test IDs + menu-open assertions (trigger `aria-expanded`) before clicking action items.
- 2026-02-08 - e2e issue - Listings row-action still flaked when search query updates were still propagating; fix was to wait for URL query state (`expectUrlParam("query", value)`) before opening row actions.
- 2026-02-08 - e2e issue - `scrollIntoViewIfNeeded()` on row-action trigger can throw `Element is not attached to the DOM` during table re-render; direct locator `.click()` was more stable for this trigger.
- 2026-02-08 - e2e issue - URL-param assertions (`expect.poll` on `page.url()`) were flaky in CI/act despite correct UI behavior; replacing with table/page-indicator assertions removed false negatives.
- 2026-02-08 - e2e issue - `page.locator("table").first()` is brittle when pages render multiple tables; scope all row locators to container test ids (`list-table`, `manage-list-table`) to avoid wrong-table clicks and detach.
- 2026-02-09 - seo/public routes - Avoid `as const` on Prisma `where` filter objects (`OR` arrays become readonly and break Prisma + no-unsafe typing across route outputs).
- 2026-02-09 - tooling - `pnpm install` runs `prisma generate` and may rewrite generated client paths/binary targets to local machine values; revert generated noise before finalizing changes.
- 2026-02-10 - dual-write - User prefers Prisma ORM writes over raw SQL for dual-write paths; if cultivar reference rows are missing, throw explicit runtime error instead of auto-creating with raw SQL.
- 2026-02-10 - migration docs - For migration follow-ups, provide task breakdown as JSON with explicit `completed` boolean fields so lower-context agents can execute safely.
- 2026-02-10 - edit dialog bug - Unlinking AHS in `AhsListingLink` can be reverted on dialog close if `ListingForm` still holds stale `ahsId`; sync `ahsId` into form state on link/unlink success to prevent close-save from re-linking.
- 2026-02-10 - unlink/save regression - Better fix was decoupling: keep `ahsId` out of form schema/state and allow router `update` input to accept optional `ahsId` for link/unlink component calls only; this prevents Save from re-linking stale AHS data.
- 2026-02-10 - api boundary cleanup - Final simplification: `AhsListingLink` should call `listing.linkAhs`/`listing.unlinkAhs` directly; then `listing.update` can stay form-only (`listingFormSchema`) with no `ahsId` handling.
- 2026-02-11 - pre-merge stabilization - For AHS V2 flagged rollout, keep `syncAhsName` strict canonical (`cultivarReference.ahsListing` only), keep secret menu override client-only, and enforce data invariants with SQL checks in migration docs.
- 2026-02-11 - create dialog regression - Empty/whitespace title must fall back to selected AHS name (then default listing name) so create payload never sends blank titles.

## Preferences

- Use the term `napkin` (not `codex napkin`).
- Keep E2E tests UI-only; if UI behavior fails, test should fail (don't hide with non-UI shortcuts).
- Use a 3-step DB rollout for this repo's AHS migration work: Prisma structural migration, then generated SQL file for reference-table data load, then generated SQL file for listing backfill.
- Avoid `executeRawUnsafe` in application and migration-adjacent app code when Prisma ORM operations can do the job.
- For product-feedback asks, return prioritized recommendations tied to activation, conversion, and retention.
- During AHS V2 rollout, keep API inputs backward-compatible (`ahsId` + `cultivarReferenceId`) until post-cutover cleanup.

## Patterns That Work

- Simplify first: remove stability scaffolding, then re-add only minimal waits tied to real UI/events when failures prove necessary.
- Use `--repeat-each` to prove changes: spec-level `--repeat-each 3` while iterating, then suite-level `tests/e2e/*.e2e.ts --repeat-each 2`.
- Prefer UI signals (visible/enabled/url/assertions) over polling and explicit timeouts.
- For Radix dropdown interactions in table rows, use open-menu assertions (`data-state=\"open\"`) and action-specific selectors instead of structural table locators (`table.last()`, `aria-controls`).
- Scope table interactions to test-id containers first, then table internals (avoid global `table.first()` selectors).

## Patterns That Fail

- Preemptive "stability" code (long custom timeouts, retry loops, blanket force-clicks) made tests harder to reason about.
- Reloading immediately after EditorJS typing without waiting for save completion caused flaky assertions.
- Pressing submit after entering Clerk verification code added instability; code field completion should auto-submit.
- Row-action flows tied to table re-renders can detach menu items mid-click; generic `getByRole(\"menuitem\")` across the page is brittle.
- `scrollIntoViewIfNeeded()` is not universally safer; on rapidly rerendering table rows it can increase detach failures.
- URL-state polling as a primary assertion layer can fail even when the visible table state is correct.

## Domain Notes

- Occasional server-side `ECONNRESET` or transient tRPC errors may appear during runs; prioritize actual test assertion failures over noisy logs.
