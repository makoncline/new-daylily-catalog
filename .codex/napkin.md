# Napkin

## Log

- 2026-02-14 - dashboardDb cultivar refs - For main dashboard TanStack DB cutover, prefer cultivar-reference cache option (1): cache only refs referenced by the user's listings; keep listing payloads small (only `cultivarReferenceId`) and join locally for AHS display. Do not expose `ahsId` as a standalone field (nested `ahsListing` is OK for now).
- 2026-02-14 - dashboardDb persisted SWR - For faster reloads, hydrate dashboardDb collections from a per-user IndexedDB snapshot (toggle via a single const) then revalidate in background. Because sync endpoints are upserts-only (no deletions), schedule snapshot persistence after key mutations (especially deletes) to prevent resurrecting deleted rows on reload.
- 2026-02-14 - dashboardDb hardening - Provider should gate rendering on collection readiness (prevents "write before sync context" crashes) and purge `["dashboard-db"]` query cache + collection cleanup on logout/auth change to avoid cross-user flashes during debugging.
- 2026-02-14 - dashboardDb bootstrap - Factor the repeated init sequence (set current user, seed query cache, set cursor, clear tombstones, preload) into `bootstrapDashboardDbCollection` so it stays consistent across collections and is harder to regress.
- 2026-02-14 - dashboardDb cursors - For incremental sync, advance cursors to the max `updatedAt` observed in returned rows (and keep previous cursor on empty results). Setting cursor to "now" can permanently skip writes that occur during the sync window. Also: `collection.utils.refetch()` won't run if the underlying TanStack Query is disabled; keep query-collections `enabled: true`.
- 2026-02-14 - legacy listing status - Treat any legacy `status` values other than `STATUS.HIDDEN` as published/null so forms don't crash on `"published"` or `""`.
- 2026-02-12 - prisma artifacts - Do not commit generated Prisma client output (`prisma/generated/sqlite-client`) or SQLite DB files; commit schema + migration/source changes only.
- 2026-02-12 - next route config - Route-segment exports like `export const revalidate` and `export const dynamicParams` must stay literal in the page file; imported config/object property values can fail static parsing.
- 2026-02-12 - profile deep-link UX - For `?viewing=` on public profile, avoid transient “Listing not found”; fetch `public.getListing` when the ID is not in loaded pages and show a loading state until query resolves.
- 2026-02-12 - cleanup preference - For agent cleanup passes, user prefers concise readable code with minimal defensive noise; keep composition explicit and align tests to current data contracts (e.g. AHS-only hero images).
- 2026-02-11 - cultivar page revamp - User wants cultivar pages grouped by pro catalogs (not flat listings), with AHS hero image, no add-to-cart, and listing deep links via `/:slug?viewing=:listingId`.
- 2026-02-11 - routing migration - User chose global cultivar canonicals (`/cultivar/:normalizedName`) with cultivar pages showing all sellers, while legacy listing route should only redirect canonical `/:userId/:listingId` to `/:userSlug?viewing=:listingId`.
- 2026-02-12 - seo/crawling - For cultivar sitemap entries, avoid `lastModified: new Date()` noise; use real entity timestamps (cultivar/listing `updatedAt`) and include AHS image in cultivar OG/Twitter metadata when present.
- 2026-02-12 - cultivar slug canonical - User wants clean cultivar URL slugs (slugified, not URI-encoded punctuation) and sitemap/static generation aligned to listing-backed cultivars by config.
- 2026-02-12 - cultivar redesign - User wants conversion-first cultivar page with offers toolbar query params (`offerSort`, `offerForSale`, `offerHasPhoto`), no public add-photo CTA, and related cultivars limited to image-backed public pages.
- 2026-02-09 - ahs migration - User wants data migration SQL to be generated by script, not hand-authored, so reruns are deterministic and auditable.
- 2026-02-09 - conversion UX - Reused `FloatingCartButton` dialog state for a new top-of-profile `Contact Seller` CTA while keeping the bottom-right floating button.
- 2026-02-09 - product review correction - Public listing has a bottom-right floating contact/cart action; it was easy to miss in snapshots because icon-only controls lacked clear labels in the accessibility tree.
- 2026-02-09 - product review - When asked for customer-value feedback, run Playwright on public flows (home -> catalogs -> catalog -> listing -> auth modal) and prioritize activation, conversion, and retention gaps with concrete examples.
- 2026-02-09 - e2e observability - Force `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_ENABLED=false` in Playwright local config and `webServer.env` so local E2E never initializes Sentry.
- 2026-02-07 - e2e cleanup - Full suite stabilized after removing most custom timeout/retry/poll code and validating with repeats.
- 2026-02-07 - e2e issue - Profile content sometimes disappeared after reload due autosave race; fixed by waiting for `userProfile.updateContent` response after blur.
- 2026-02-07 - e2e issue - Clerk modal has variant state: after email click `Continue`; after code entry do not submit again (auto-submit). If warning says code wasn't sent, click `Continue` once.
- 2026-02-07 - e2e issue - Select/popup items can be outside viewport; `scrollIntoViewIfNeeded()` before click fixed intermittent failures.
- 2026-02-07 - e2e issue - Listings row-action dropdown was flaky in CI/local when relying on generic role selectors or `force: true`; stable approach is explicit row-action test IDs + menu-open assertions (trigger `aria-expanded`) before clicking action items.
- 2026-02-08 - e2e issue - Listings row-action still flaked when search query updates were still propagating; fix was to wait for URL query state (`expectUrlParam("query", value)`) before opening row actions.
- 2026-02-08 - e2e issue - `scrollIntoViewIfNeeded()` on row-action trigger can throw `Element is not attached to the DOM` during table re-render; direct locator `.click()` was more stable for this trigger.
- 2026-02-08 - e2e issue - URL-param assertions (`expect.poll` on `page.url()`) were flaky in CI/act despite correct UI behavior; replacing with table/page-indicator assertions removed false negatives.
- 2026-02-08 - e2e issue - `page.locator("table").first()` is brittle when pages render multiple tables; scope all row locators to container test ids (`list-table`, `manage-list-table`) to avoid wrong-table clicks and detach.
- 2026-02-09 - seo/public routes - Avoid `as const` on Prisma `where` filter objects (`OR` arrays become readonly and break Prisma + no-unsafe typing across route outputs).
- 2026-02-09 - tooling - `pnpm install` runs `prisma generate` and may rewrite generated client paths/binary targets to local machine values; revert generated noise before finalizing changes.
- 2026-02-10 - dual-write - User prefers Prisma ORM writes over raw SQL for dual-write paths; if cultivar reference rows are missing, throw explicit runtime error instead of auto-creating with raw SQL.
- 2026-02-10 - migration docs - For migration follow-ups, provide task breakdown as JSON with explicit `completed` boolean fields so lower-context agents can execute safely.
- 2026-02-10 - edit dialog bug - Unlinking AHS in `AhsListingLink` can be reverted on dialog close if `ListingForm` still holds stale `ahsId`; sync `ahsId` into form state on link/unlink success to prevent close-save from re-linking.
- 2026-02-10 - unlink/save regression - Better fix was decoupling: keep `ahsId` out of form schema/state and allow router `update` input to accept optional `ahsId` for link/unlink component calls only; this prevents Save from re-linking stale AHS data.
- 2026-02-10 - api boundary cleanup - Final simplification: `AhsListingLink` should call `listing.linkAhs`/`listing.unlinkAhs` directly; then `listing.update` can stay form-only (`listingFormSchema`) with no `ahsId` handling.
- 2026-02-11 - pre-merge stabilization - For AHS V2 flagged rollout, keep `syncAhsName` strict canonical (`cultivarReference.ahsListing` only), keep secret menu override client-only, and enforce data invariants with SQL checks in migration docs.
- 2026-02-11 - create dialog regression - Empty/whitespace title must fall back to selected AHS name (then default listing name) so create payload never sends blank titles.
- 2026-02-11 - type alignment - When router responses add derived `ahsListing` via `withDisplayAhsListing(s)`, hook return types must use `WithDisplayAhsListing<T>` and sibling routers (e.g. `list.getListings`) should return the same derived shape to avoid table generic mismatches.
- 2026-02-11 - e2e temp-db reset - `withTempE2EDb` must clear `CultivarReference` before `AhsListing`; otherwise retries leave orphaned refs (`ahsId` null) and deterministic seed upserts can fail unique on `CultivarReference.id`.
- 2026-02-13 - prisma db push - Prisma schema engine can fail to start when `RUST_LOG=warn`; set `RUST_LOG=info` (and clear `NODE_OPTIONS`) for `prisma db push` in scripts/tests.
- 2026-02-13 - tanstack db collections - `@tanstack/query-db-collection` write utils require sync context; start collection sync via `useLiveQuery` subscription or `await collection.preload()` (after seeding query cache) before calling `utils.writeInsert`/`writeUpdate`/`writeDelete`.
- 2026-02-13 - tanstack db SSR - Next can server-render client components; `useLiveQuery` can warn (`Missing getServerSnapshot`) if it hits SSR. Fix by rendering live-query components client-only (dynamic import `ssr:false` or mount-gate and put `useLiveQuery` in a child rendered only after `useEffect`).
- 2026-02-13 - data-table column filters - `useDataTable` URL-sync only tracks columns with `filterFn`; if a column shows a filter UI, ensure it sets `filterFn` (e.g. `fuzzyFilter`) or the filter can be dropped on search-param navigation.
- 2026-02-13 - e2e popover filters - Radix popover filter inputs can detach during URL-sync/table rerenders; in Playwright, target by exact placeholder and retry after `Escape` + reopen.
- 2026-02-13 - unit test env - Importing the full `appRouter` can eagerly construct clients (e.g. Stripe) and crash if env vars are missing even with `SKIP_ENV_VALIDATION=1`; set minimal placeholder env vars or import routers directly.

## Preferences

- Write tests, not too many, mostly integration, hapy path e2e.
- TanStack DB dashboard migration: keep procedures under new `dashboardDb` router, migrate main `/dashboard` page-by-page, and run `pnpm lint`, `npx tsc --noEmit`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm test:e2e` before each incremental commit.
- Cultivar pages should be catalog-centric (catalog cards with nested cultivar listing rows), not listing-card grids.
- Use composition patterns for new UI components (prefer explicit composed sections over boolean-mode props).
- Use the term `napkin` (not `codex napkin`).
- Keep E2E tests UI-only; if UI behavior fails, test should fail (don't hide with non-UI shortcuts).
- Use a 3-step DB rollout for this repo's AHS migration work: Prisma structural migration, then generated SQL file for reference-table data load, then generated SQL file for listing backfill.
- Avoid `executeRawUnsafe` in application and migration-adjacent app code when Prisma ORM operations can do the job.
- For product-feedback asks, return prioritized recommendations tied to activation, conversion, and retention.
- During AHS V2 rollout, keep API inputs backward-compatible (`ahsId` + `cultivarReferenceId`) until post-cutover cleanup.

## Patterns That Work

- Simplify first: remove stability scaffolding, then re-add only minimal waits tied to real UI/events when failures prove necessary.
- Use `--repeat-each` to prove changes: spec-level `--repeat-each 3` while iterating, then suite-level `tests/e2e/*.e2e.ts --repeat-each 2`.
- Prefer UI signals (visible/enabled/url/assertions) over polling and explicit timeouts.
- For Radix dropdown interactions in table rows, use open-menu assertions (`data-state=\"open\"`) and action-specific selectors instead of structural table locators (`table.last()`, `aria-controls`).
- Scope table interactions to test-id containers first, then table internals (avoid global `table.first()` selectors).

## Patterns That Fail

- Preemptive "stability" code (long custom timeouts, retry loops, blanket force-clicks) made tests harder to reason about.
- Reloading immediately after EditorJS typing without waiting for save completion caused flaky assertions.
- Pressing submit after entering Clerk verification code added instability; code field completion should auto-submit.
- Row-action flows tied to table re-renders can detach menu items mid-click; generic `getByRole(\"menuitem\")` across the page is brittle.
- `scrollIntoViewIfNeeded()` is not universally safer; on rapidly rerendering table rows it can increase detach failures.
- URL-state polling as a primary assertion layer can fail even when the visible table state is correct.

## Domain Notes

- Occasional server-side `ECONNRESET` or transient tRPC errors may appear during runs; prioritize actual test assertion failures over noisy logs.
